# CTPS computations.
#
# PSDesc / PolyMap / MulSchedule2D / CompPlan are pure combinatorial index
# tables (compile-time constants after set_descriptor! is called).
# DescPool holds pre-allocated scratch buffers shared across calls; it is
# never part of the differentiable computation path.
#
# These rules are loaded automatically whenever both TPSA and Enzyme are
# present in the same session — no user action required.
