## Running Examples

Run any example directly:
```julia
julia examples/01_basic_operations.jl
```

Or include within a Julia session:
```julia
using TPSA
include("examples/02_math_functions.jl")
```

## Prerequisites

Make sure TPSA is loaded:
```julia
using TPSA
```

Some examples may require additional packages:
```julia
using LinearAlgebra  # For matrix operations (example 06)
using Printf         # For formatted output
```

## Learning Path

Recommended order for learning:
1. Start with `01_basic_operations.jl` to understand TPSA fundamentals
2. Move to `02_math_functions.jl` for function operations
3. Learn coefficient access with `04_index_mapping.jl`
4. Practice evaluation with `03_plugin_values.jl`
5. Explore calculus in `05_derivatives_integration.jl`
6. Apply to real problems with `06_matrix_construction.jl`

## Development Scripts

Old debugging and development scripts have been moved to `../dev_scripts/` for reference.
